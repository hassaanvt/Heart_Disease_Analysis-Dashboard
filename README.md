# Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard
"This Power BI dashboard analyzes heart disease patient data to track survival rates, average survival age, and key health indicators across age groups. It visualizes the impact of serum creatinine, ejection fraction, smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, and diabetes on survival, helping identify high-risk groups and trends."

Project Title:
Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

Dashboard 



Project Overview:
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of heart disease patient data, focusing on survival rates, average survival age, and factors affecting survival such as serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, and co-morbidities. It allows healthcare professionals to identify patterns across different age groups and understand the impact of various health conditions on survival outcomes.

Tools & Technology:
1. Tool: Microsoft Power BI
2. Data Source: Heart disease patient dataset
3. Techniques: Data visualization, DAX calculations, interactive filtering, comparative analysis

Data Description:
The dataset includes patient demographic details (age, gender), survival status, survival duration, clinical measurements (serum creatinine, ejection fraction), and health conditions (smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, diabetes).

Project Objectives:
1.	Measure overall survival rate and average survival age.
2.	Analyze survival counts and health metrics (serum creatinine, ejection fraction) by age group.
3.	Identify survival rate trends across different age groups.
4.	Assess the impact of smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, and diabetes on survival by age group.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.	Import heart disease dataset into Power BI.
2.	Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, format columns).
3.	Create DAX measures for survival rate, average survival age, and counts.
4.	Build visuals for:
o	KPI cards: Survival Rate, Avg Age of Survival, Total Survival, Total Death.
o	Bar & Line charts: Survival Count vs. Serum Creatinine, Survival Count vs. Ejection Fraction.
o	Area chart: Survival Rate by Age Group.
o	Ribbon chart: Impact of smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, diabetes.
5.	Apply gender filter for interactive analysis.

Key Insights:
1. The overall survival rate is 68.04% with an average survival age of 58.83 years.
2. The 61–70 age group has the highest number of survival cases but shows a decline in ejection fraction and a higher serum creatinine level compared to younger groups.
3. Survival rates gradually decline with age, with the lowest rate in the 71+ group.
4. Smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, and diabetes have a significant combined impact on older age groups.
